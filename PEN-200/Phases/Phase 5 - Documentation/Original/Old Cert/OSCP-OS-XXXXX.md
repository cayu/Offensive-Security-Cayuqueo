# OSCP Report Templates
This repo contains my templates for the OSCP Lab and OSCP Exam Reports. The reports are nearly identical, with minor variations between them.

I wanted to share these templates with the community to help alleviate some of the stress people feel when they start their report.

**Notable Edits - Lab Report**

1. Updated version to 3.2
2. Updated the Table of Contents to reflect the new data flow of the document
3. Added more information to the High Level Summary
4. Added a total of 10 machine sections. (Copy and paste these if you are reporting more than the 10 machines required for the lab report)
5. Updated 3.1 Information Gathering (For each machine, I create a link to the associated machine)
6. Updated the documentation flow. Each Machine is given its own section. Creates a boot to root walkthrough feel for each machine
7. Added the Service Enumeration table to each machine section instead of one table for the entire report
8. Added a header for Nmap scan results (screenshot)
9. Added a header for Initial Shell Screenshot
10. Added headers for Proof.txt Contents and the Proof.txt Screenshot
11. Added Appendix 1 - Proof Contents. This is an easy way to track those keys
12. Added Appendix 2 - PWK Course Exercises
13. Included all the headers for the requested exercises. The exercises are not included, as they are present in the course material
